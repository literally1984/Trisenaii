IMPORTANT:

This game utilizes ANSI escape codes, which are used to clear the console.

If the software you are using to run this game doesn't support ANSI escape codes, then remove System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J"); from lines 114, 122, 147, 155, and 290.

Usually, Linux based shells support these codes, and Windows based shells do not, so, for example, if you're using the Eclipse IDE on Mac or Linux, then the codes will work. If you're using Eclipse on Windows, they will not work.
